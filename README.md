# CRM-Test

This is a simple test script using Selenium for the CRM also found in my GitHub profile.

So far the feature testing is very limited. It tests the following:
 - Entering the correct login credentials will result in a successful login.
 - The dashboard button links to the dashboard
 - The "Create New Task" link links to the correct form.
 - Sample tasks can be successfully created.
 
 The script will eventually test the following:
 - Does entering incorrect credentials result in a redirect to the proper page?
 - Does the "Add Company" button link to the proper page?
 - Can a sample company be added successfully?
 - Which special characters, when entered into the forms, will be rejected?
 - Is the database susceptible to an SQL injection attack?
 - more to be added later
